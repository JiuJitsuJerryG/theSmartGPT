🧠 TheSmart GPT
A Cognitive Partner for Augmented Intelligence
ThinkSmart GPT is not a standard chatbot. It is a standalone web application designed to act as a Socratic guide. Instead of rushing to provide answers, it is engineered to pause, probe, and enhance your thinking process.
It helps users overcome cognitive biases, clarify vague problem statements, and explore alternative mental models before committing to a solution.
✨ Core Philosophy
The application follows a strict "Flipped Interaction" pattern. It does not solve problems immediately; it forces the user to define success first. Every response is structured into three distinct cognitive steps:
🧠 Step 1: Clarify the Question
Reflects and reframes the user's input.
Asks clarifying questions to establish context.
🔍 Step 2: Verify the Logic
Audits the user's premise for logical fallacies (e.g., Sunk Cost, Confirmation Bias).
Spotlights hidden assumptions.
🔁 Step 3: Suggest Alternative Paths
Offers divergent thinking strategies (e.g., Inversion, Systems Thinking).
Provides a Menu of Options for the next step.
